\sc Task 				& 	Car diagnoses task													\\ \hline
\sc Organization 			& 	This task is not part of an organization and is executed by a hobbyist.					\\ \hline
\sc Goal and value 		& 	To find the cause of an observed problem. Once the cause is know it might 
						be possible to repair the problem or bring the car tho a garage so they can fix the problem.	\\ \hline
\sc Dependency and flow 	&	{\em Input tasks}: None													\newline
   						{\em Output tasks}: Car repair task 										\\ \hline
\sc Objects handled 		&	{\em Input objects}: An observed problem, type of car.							\newline
   						{\em Output objects}: Cause(s) of the observed problem.							\newline
   						{\em Internal objects}: General car knowledge, specific car knowledge					\\ \hline
\sc Timing and control		& 	The task is performed only when a problem is observed, which is expected to be very infrequent.
						The task might take from about 15 min to a few hours. 							\newline
						{\em preconditions} There must be an observed problem. 							\newline
						{\em postconditions} One or more causes for the observed problem are reported or the system 
						reports it could not find the problem.										\newline
						{\em constraints} The system needs access to the car knowledge of the specified car.		\\ \hline
\sc Agents 				&	The hobbyist, the car diagnoses system										\\ \hline
\sc Knowledge and competence 	& 	The hobbyist needs to be able to preform certain tests, interpret the results correctly and give
						them to the car diagnoses system. 											\\ \hline
\sc Resources 			& 	The task will consume the time of the person performing it. In addition, depending on the 
						problem being diagnosed, some measuring equipment and/or spare parts might be needed. 		\\ \hline
\sc Quality and performance 	& 	The quality measure will be that the identified cause is the real cause of the problem. The 
						performance will be measured by the time it takes to diagnose the problem.				\\ \hline
