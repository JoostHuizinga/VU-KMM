\section{Context model}
This section contains the tables OM-1, OM-2, OM-5, TM-1, TM-2, AM-1. Since our problem is based on a single person that repairs his car in its own time there is no organization. This makes organizational structures or flows quite impossible to create. Nevertheless, most parts of the forms that concern the organizational model are still relevant.
