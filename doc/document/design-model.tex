Structural design model.
see \ref{fig:designmodel1}. Application is in Java. Knowledge mostly in Jess and
for a part in Java (see section on inferences). Java application starts jess
engine with working memory.

In the working memory are the domain rules, facts
that represent inferential knowledge of car, and the domain parts, knowledge
about the current status of parts of the car. Domain rules are not modified over
a run of the program, domain parts are modified.

Information from the app goes to jess by asserting
support facts, these are then interpeted as modifications of domain parts.
Inferences made by Jess go to the app by queries made by the app.

The Jess parts is divided in a engine and a domain part. The domain rules and
domain parts are implementations of templates supplied by the engine. The
engines inferences makes forward and backward reasonings from these rules and
parts. The domain rules and parts can be substituted by rules and parts from a
different domain while keeping the engine. The rules might be understandable by an
expert or user, our car repair hobbyist does. The complexity of the inferences
made by the engine are not visible in the domain part.
