\section{Introduction}
Cars are probably the most important vehicle of our century. Where most people would use cars only for transport some have turned their car in a hobby. For these hobbyists, performing minor upgrades and repairs on there cars is about as important as driving the car.

Unfortunately its is sometimes difficult to find the right information to perform repairs and upgrades. For this problem we developed the car repair assistant. The car repair assistant is a knowledge system that helps with the identification and repair of various problems a car might have.

Because car repair is a very wide problem area we have narrowed it down to only the electrical system. Most of our models nevertheless assume the complete car repair assistant. It are the domain specific models that only consider the electrical system of the car.
